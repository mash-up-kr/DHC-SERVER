      summary: "[QA] 홈 화면 상태 오버라이드"
      description: |
        **QA 테스트 전용 API** - 홈 화면(`/view/users/{userId}/home`)의 `longAbsence`, `yesterdayMissionSuccess`, `todayDone` 값을 강제로 설정합니다.

        이 3개 값은 원래 서버에서 매번 계산되는 값이므로, 이 API로 오버라이드를 설정하면 계산 결과 대신 오버라이드 값이 반환됩니다.

        ### 사용 시나리오
ㅡ다음         - **2일 이상 미접속 화면 테스트**: `longAbsence: true` 설정
        - **어제 미션 성공 후 홈 화면 테스트**: `yesterdayMissionSuccess: true` 설정
        - **오늘 미션 완료 후 화면 테스트**: `todayDone: true` 설정
        - **조합 테스트**: 여러 값을 동시에 설정 가능

        ### 오버라이드 해제
        각 필드를 `null`로 보내면 오버라이드가 해제되고 원래 계산 로직으로 복원됩니다.
        ```json
        { "longAbsence": null, "yesterdayMissionSuccess": null, "todayDone": null }
        ```

        ### 주의사항
        - 오버라이드는 해당 유저에게 영구적으로 적용됩니다 (해제할 때까지)
        - QA 테스트 완료 후 반드시 `null`로 초기화하세요

        **QA 테스트 전용 API** - 유저의 연간 운세 사용 기록을 삭제하여 다시 사용할 수 있도록 원복합니다.

        이 API를 호출하면:
        - `yearlyFortuneUsed` → `false`로 변경
        - `yearlyFortune` → `null`로 삭제

        ### 사용 시나리오
        1. 포인트 API로 LV8 이상 설정 (`PUT /api/qa/users/{userId}/point` → `{ "point": 1300 }`)
        2. 연간 운세 생성 (`POST /api/users/{userId}/yearly-fortune`)
        3. 연간 운세 확인 (`GET /view/users/{userId}/yearly-fortune`)
        4. **이 API로 원복** (`DELETE /api/qa/users/{userId}/yearly-fortune`)
        5. 다시 2번부터 반복 테스트 가능

        ### 주의사항
        - 이 API는 `yearlyFortuneUsed` 플래그만 리셋합니다. 포인트/레벨은 별도로 관리하세요.
        - 연간 운세 재생성 시 Gemini API가 다시 호출되므로 다른 결과가 나올 수 있습니다.
